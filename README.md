### Project Overview
This is the team project of CS5800 Algorithms. In this project, we aim to implement algorithms k-Nearest Neighbors for continuous variables with tested program and GUI. The project will be divided into multiple modules, with each team member responsible for specific tasks.
### Team Name: 3Cs
* **Chinese** — all of us are from China.
* **Collaboration** — We value teamwork to achieve our goals.
* **Creativity** — Innovation and problem is the core of how we approach challenges.
### Team Members
* **Erdun E**
* **Hailee Wang**
* **Fengkai Liu**
### Basic Information
* **Author:** Erdun E, Hailee Wang, Fengkai Liu
* **Course:** CS5800 Algorithm
* **Program:** CS5800 Final Project
* **Professor:** Dr. Alan Jamieson

### Project Structure
```aiignore
* Main                  [Kai]
* Controller            [Kai]      
* Visualizer            [Kai]

```
### Dataset
[iris.csv](https://github.com/ErdunE/CS5800-Final-Project/blob/main/iris.csv)

### Branching Strategy
* Main Branch: main
* Feature Branch Naming Convention: workspace-[workspace-name] (e.g., workspace-erdun)
* All development should be done on workspace branches, and changes will only be merged into the team-project branch after review.
### Commit and Pull Request Guidelines
* Create a workspace branch for each member specific task.
* Push your changes to the workspace branch and open a Pull Request (PR) to merge into the team-project branch.
* Code Review: At least one team member must review and approve the PR before merging.
* Ensure tests pass before merging into the main project branch.
### Collaboration Workflow
1. Clone the Repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/ErdunE/CS5800-Final-Project.git
cd CS5800-Final-Project
```
example
```aiignore
erdune@ErdundeMBP CS5800-Final-Project % pwd
/Users/erdune/Desktop/CS5800-Final-Project
```
2. Create a Feature Branch:
```
git checkout -b workspace-erdun team-project
```
example
```
erdune@ErdundeMacBook-Pro CS5800_Final_Project % git checkout -b workspace-erdun team-project
M       .DS_Store
M       CS5010ProgrammingDesignParadigm/.DS_Store
M       CS5800Algorithm/.DS_Store
Switched to a new branch ‘workspace-erdun’
erdune@ErdundeMacBook-Pro CS5800_Final_Project % git branch
  feature-improvement
  main
  team-project
* workspace-erdun
erdune@ErdundeMacBook-Pro CS5800_Final_Project % 

```
3. Commit and Push Your Changes:
```
git add .
git commit -m “Implemented Algorithms Logic”
git push origin workspace-erdun
```
4. Create a Pull Request (PR):
    * Open a PR on GitHub to merge your feature branch into the team-project branch.
    * Request at least one other team member to review your PR.
5. Merge Changes:
    * Once the review is approved, and all tests pass, merge the PR.
